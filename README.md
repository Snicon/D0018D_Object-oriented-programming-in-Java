# D0018D (Spring 25) - [Object oriented programming in Java](https://www.ltu.se/utbildning/kurs/d00/d0018d-objektorienterad-programmering-i-java) @ [LTU](https://ltu.se/en)
This is the continuation course of [Initial programming in Java](https://www.ltu.se/en/education/course/d00/d0017d-initial-programming-in-java). In this course we are specifically focusing on using OOP in Java to make a banking system. Each assignment builds on top of the other starting out with some simple classes and methods. The finished product will be a simple banking system with a GUI and database.

## Structure
This repo contains all the marked assignments I've worked on.
